    <h4>Moveable Feasts</h4>
    <div class="left-card-p">
     <p>Moveable Feasts was my graduation project which aims to pair ex-pats, recently moved people, or immigrants with hosts for dinner parties. This app acts as a new social connector for hosts and guests to create frienships in more intimate settings.<br>This app was created on the base of the MVC pattern and the coding languages used are: <span class="icons"><i class="fab fa-html5"></i> <i class="fab fa-css3-alt"></i> <i class="fab fa-js"></i></span>, Ruby as a backend language using Ruby on Rails framework and SQL for the Database using Active Record library. The maps used are from Mapbox, Cloudinary was used to save the uploaded images and of course the fonts used are from Google fonts.</p>

        <h4>Book Borrow</h4>
        <div class="project-right-card-p">
          <p>Book Borrow is an app that enables you to borrow books without wasting your money on books that you don't want to own or lend books that inconveniently take too much space.
          The idea behind it is to create an intellectual atmospher with new people and create friendships.
